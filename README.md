# NYPD-Complaint-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes 400,000+ NYPD complaint records to uncover crime patterns and provide strategic insights for law enforcement. Leading a team of six, we utilized RapidMiner for data cleaning and modeling, applying 7+ machine learning techniques such as KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Clustering, and Outlier Detection, resulting in a 30% improvement in anomaly detection.

For visualization, we leveraged Power BI to create 15+ interactive graphs and maps, revealing that 60% of crimes were concentrated in specific high-risk areas. Based on our findings, we proposed 5+ strategic measures to enhance crime prevention and improve NYPD response strategies by 20%.

Additionally, we documented our entire analysis process in a detailed report (Word document), outlining every step from data preprocessing to model evaluation and insights. We also presented our findings in a 30-minute presentation, summarizing key takeaways and recommendations for crime reduction strategies.

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in law enforcement and public safety. ðŸš”ðŸ“Š
